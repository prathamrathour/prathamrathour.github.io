<p id="topic">Why are the fires so bad?</p></div>
<p id="text">Fire season in Australia is always dangerous -- the 2009 Black Saturday fires killed 173 people in Victoria, making it the deadliest bushfire disaster on record. But conditions have been unusually severe this year, fanning the flames and making firefighting conditions particularly difficult.</p>
<p id ="text">Australia is experiencing one of its worst droughts in decades -- the country's Bureau of Meteorology said in December that last spring was the driest on record. Meanwhile, a heatwave in December broke the record for highest nationwide average temperature, with some places sweltering under temperatures well above 40 degrees Celsius (about 113-120 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>
<p id ="text">Strong winds have also made the fires and smoke spread more rapidly, and have led to fatalities -- a 28-year-old volunteer firefighter died in NSW in December after his truck rolled over in high winds.</p>

<div ><p id ="topic">What has been the damage so far?</p></div>
<div ><img id ="img" src="https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/ca_1122NID_Australia_Fire_2019_online.jpg?itok=msL7HmBj" width="1200px" height="600px"/></div>
<p id="text">Entire towns have been engulfed in flames, and residents across several states have lost their homes. The heaviest structural damage occurred in NSW, the country's most populated state, where 1,588 homes have been destroyed and over 650 damaged. </p>
<p id="text"> In total, more than 7.3 million hectares (17.9 million acres) have been burned across Australia's six states -- an area larger than the countries of Belgium and Denmark combined. The worst-affected state is NSW, with more than 4.9 million hectares (12.1 million acres) burned.</p>
<p id="text">To put that into perspective, the 2019 Amazon rainforest fires burned more than 7 million hectares (about 17.5 million acres), according to Brazilian officials. In California, which is known for its deadly wildfires, just over 100,000 hectares (247,000 acres) burned in 2019, and about 404,680 hectares (1 million acres) in 2018.</p>

<div ><p id="topic">How many animals have died?</p></div>
<div ><img  id="img" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Yw5MM2-aR8/maxresdefault.jpg"></div>
<p id="text">About half a billion animals have been affected by the fires across NSW, with millions likely dead -- and that's a conservative estimate. That number of total animals affected could be as high as one billion nationwide, according to ecologists from the University of Sydney.</p>
<p id="text">The figures for NSW include birds, reptiles, and mammals, except bats. It also excludes insects and frogs, so the real sum is almost certain to be higher, the ecologists said.
Almost a third of koalas in NSW may have been killed in the fires, and a third of their habitat has been destroyed, said Federal Environment Minister Sussan Ley.</p>
<p id="text">Some species, like koalas, aren't in any immediate danger of extinction because they are spread out across the country, said the university ecologists. But others that live in more niche environments with lower populations, including certain types of frogs and birds, could be wiped out entirely if their habitats are hit by the fires.</p>
<p id="text">These are pretty good estimates based on previous research on population density -- but until the fires stop, researchers have no way of surveying just how extensive the damage is, and exactly how many animals have died.</p>

<div ><p id="topic">What is being done?</p></div>
<div ><img  id="img" src="https://www.witf.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/australia-fire-jan-20_2-e1578480112348-1920x1046.jpg" width="1200px" height="600px"/></div>
<p id="text">State and federal authorities have been working to combat the fire crisis for months.
Early in January, Victoria declared a state of disaster and NSW declared a state of emergency -- both granting extraordinary powers and additional government resources to battle the fires. The state of Queensland also briefly declared a state of emergency in November.</p>
<p id="text">There are more than 2,000 firefighters working on the ground in NSW alone, and more support is on the way -- the US, Canada, and New Zealand have sent additional firefighters to help.
The federal government has also sent in military assistance like army personnel, air force aircraft, and navy cruisers for firefighting, evacuation, search and rescue, and clean-up efforts.
The Morrison administration has also allocated billions of dollars in federal aid, to help rebuild vital infrastructure like schools and health facilities struck by fire.</p>
